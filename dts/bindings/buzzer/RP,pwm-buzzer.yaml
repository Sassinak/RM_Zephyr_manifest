      Reference to a PWM instance.

      The period field is used by the set_brightness function of the LED API.
      Its value should at least be greater that 100 nanoseconds (for a full
      brightness granularity) and lesser than 50 milliseconds (average visual
      persistence time of the human eye). Typical values for the PWM period
      are 10 or 20 milliseconds.

      Human readable string describing the Buzzer. It can be used by an
      application to identify this Buzzer or to retrieve its number/index
      (i.e. child node number) on the parent device.
